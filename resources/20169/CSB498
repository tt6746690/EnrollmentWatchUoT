Course requirements include a final report and either an oral presentation (Summer session) or a poster presentation (Fall\/Winter session).&nbsp; Monthly workshops are scheduled and highly recommended.&nbsp; Details for enrollment are available at http:\/\/csb.utoronto.ca\/undergraduate-studies\/undergraduate-courses\/undergraduate-course-level-400\/.
